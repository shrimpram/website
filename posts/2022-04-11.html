<span id=001>[<a class=t href=#001>001</a>]</span> Overview
________________________________________________________________________________

A few years ago, after deciding to build my own mechanical keyboard and shopping
around for a while attempting the near impossible task of choosing one build
from the infinite combinations of parts available, I finally chose to build an
<a href="https://olkb.com/collections/planck">OLKB Planck</a>. This post explains the thoughts that went into building it as well
as the parts used and layouts.


<span id=002>[<a class=t href=#002>002</a>]</span> The Motive
________________________________________________________________________________

One of the main reasons I went the full custom route was to better allow
customization of my keyboard's layout. I had been learning and slowly
transitioning to using <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a> full time, and having the ability to customize my
keyboard down to its layout would better enable me to use Colemak without
needing to install third-party keyboard layouts. I also used it as a tool to
speed up my learning, as forcing myself to use Colemak without the option to
easily switch layouts back to QWERTY would build muscle memory faster and help
me get back to my normal typing speed.

The other main reason for choosing this particular style of keyboard also had to
do with the layout. Being able to use a custom layout enabled me to fully
utilize things such as layers to make my keyboard more ergonomic. The idea
behind layers is that rather than moving your fingers physically across the
keyboard to reach keys such as arrows, f-keys, media keys, etc. you hold down
modifiers to bring those keys to you. This relieves a lot of the strain on your
fingers when typing as they don't have to move around as much to type the same
characters. <a href="https://youtu.be/AKGXZ1ReU54">"Tiny Keyboards: An Explanation"</a> is a great video that explains the
logic behind this, and the tiny keyboard shown in the video is also a 40%
ortholinear, just like the Planck.


<span id=003>[<a class=t href=#003>003</a>]</span> The Parts
________________________________________________________________________________

(A quick disclaimer that I'm not affiliated with any of the companies listed
below nor is this an endorsement of their products but simply a blog post about
my personal keyboard.)

With that out of the way this build was based mainly around the EOTW Planck, and
as such uses parts from that version. However, at the time I was building it the
PCB and plates compatible with the EOTW bottom plate were out of stock on the
<a href="https://olkb.com">OLKB website</a> so I had to buy them from <a
href="https://drop.com">Drop</a>. I went with an XDA keycap set since
I really liked how low they sat on the keyboard and thought they would
contribute to a clean, minimal look for the build especially since it wouldn't
have a case, just a bottom plate.

* <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-xda-canvas-keycap-set">Drop + Mito XDA Canvas keycaps</a>
* <a href="https://novelkeys.com/products/nk_-cream-series">NovelKeys Cream switches</a>

As for other miscellaneous stuff I filmed and lubed the switches myself, which
for my first time ever building a keyboard let alone modding switches turned out
better than expected.

The full source of this keymap as well as compiled binaries that you can flash
to your own Planck can be found at <a href="https://github.com/shrimpram/qmk_userspace">github.com/shrimpram/qmk_userspace</a>.

--<span id=005>[<a class=t href=#005>005</a>]</span> Layer 0-----------------------------------------------------------------

  This is the default Colemak layer. The bottom row has modifier keys as
  well as the different layer keys to change between layers. There is a
  backspace where caps lock is normally located since the former is much
  more useful than the latter and I have caps lock on another layer.
  Another way QMK helps me save space is with the two shift keys.
  Normally, when pressed and released these two keys act as the key code
  in parentheses. The left shift is an escape key and the right shift is a
  slash key. However, when held while pressing another key, they act as
  shift keys and I can type uppercase letters.


--<span id=006>[<a class=t href=#006>006</a>]</span> Layer 1-----------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a QWERTY layer I have just in case, which I access by pressing <code>MO(4)</code>
  and then the spacebar. The only difference is in the alphas since all the
  modifiers and other keys have the <code>KC_TRNS</code> code which makes them transparent to
  QMK so they inherit the keycode of the next layer below them.


--<span id=007>[<a class=t href=#007>007</a>]</span> Layer 2-----------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a function and numpad layer. I opted for a numpad instead of a number
  row since at the time I was taking an accounting class and having a numpad
  allowed me to work much faster than a number row. The layout is fairly
  standard, with math operators next to the numbers as well as two enter keys
  since I couldn't figure out what else to place there and it's much easier to
  hit with the palm of my hand while keeping my fingers on the numpad.


--<span id=008>[<a class=t href=#008>008</a>]</span> Layer 3-----------------------------------------------------------------

  This layer is an extension of layer 2 with symbols instead of numbers/f-keys.
  It also has some other miscellaneous useful keys such as delete, caps lock,
  and the grave/tilde key. These other miscellaneous keys fit well here since I
  access this layer with <code>TT(3)</code> which is right next to the spacebar.


--<span id=009>[<a class=t href=#009>009</a>]</span> Layer 4-----------------------------------------------------------------

  This layer has all my media controls as well as the toggle between Colemak and
  QWERTY.
